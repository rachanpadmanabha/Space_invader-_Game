#enemy

    At first the game would start with 6 enemies randomly appearing whenever they are killed giving a +1 in score whenever they are hit with a bullet.

    When the score reaches 50 boss one boss level enemy would appear having its own 3 bullets and it would take probably 20 to 30 bullets
    to kill the boss giving a +20 on scoreboard

    the game would continue again with 9 enemies with increase in their speed
    the enemies would respawn every time they are hit with a bullet

    when the score reaches 120

    2 enemy bosses would appear shooting bullets randomly
    each needing 30 bullets to be killed

    the increment would happen in similar way every time this cycle happens

    when the enemy would go out of the screen without dying it would be respawned to the screen again


#player

    the player would be having 3 lives where each life would be decremneted with a touch of enemy or boss's bullets

    when the player lives reaches zero it would be game zero

    the player will be provided with power ups in the middle of the game in an random manner

        life power up: which would increase the player lives till it reaches 3 lives which will be the limit

        bullet power up: this power up would increase the number of bullets being shot by the player, when lost a life the no. of bullets will be reset to one

        shield power up: this power would give it protection for 1 life can be used once ig power up used at the same moment when one is activated
                            no change would appear

        total destroyer power up: would destroy all the enemies present in the screen and if the boss is present then would decrease its life by half of its life present in every level
                                    this power up would appear ocassionaly and unlike other power ups won't be that common

        laser power up : would give the player laser as its bullet where all the enemies appearing in the screen would die when they come in
                            contact with the laser
